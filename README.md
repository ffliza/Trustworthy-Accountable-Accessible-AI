BRA(AI)N - Building Resilience and Accountability in AI Navigation
Project Overview
The BRA(AI)N project explores the use of Generative AI (GenAI) tools (e.g., ChatGPT, DeepSeek) in higher education, focusing on:

How students and staff utilize AI in learning and assessments.

Challenges in teaching and assessment design.

Risks of over-reliance on AI and strategies for ethical, resilient AI integration.

This research is funded by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) through the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC).
